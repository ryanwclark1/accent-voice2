## Meet Accent Platform

Accent Platform is an Open Source project allowing to build carrier grade programmable IP communication infrastructures. You can pick and choose the components you need to build your infrastructures with **class 5 features** and **class 4 features**.

Our platform allows to setup multiple communication use cases. Find
bellow the documentation of some examples of use cases. You can of
course use your own set of services to build your own use case.
